As a **passionate chess player**, I‚Äôve always wondered how well my country performs in chess compared to others. 
When I first learned to play chess over 20 years ago, I often heard about Russia's dominance in the game and 
how countries like the United States and India were emerging as strong contenders.

However, there was no clear way to measure how other countries compared to my own in terms of chess performance. 
This curiosity inspired me to create this project. **My goal was to explore the data and uncover meaningful metrics 
and trends in the world of chess.** I‚Äôm excited to share these insights with you through this app!

    Given that the primary goal of this project is **to gain insights into how well countries perform in chess**,
    I decided to **focus on the top 100 strongest players from each country by rating over the last 10 years**.
    
    The project consists of seven pages:
    
    1. **Introduction:** This page provides an overview of the project.
    2. **Outlook:** Offers a high-level view of the data and key insights.
    3. **Continent Analysis:** Examines performance and trends by continent.
    4. **Subregion and Country Analysis:** Dives deeper into subregional and country-level performance.
    5. **Comparison Tool:** Allows comparisons between two countries or regions over a selected period.
    6. **Top 5 Chess Players:** Highlights the top 5 players over time.
    7. **Ask a Question:** A bot that answers custom queries directly from the database.

    The data used in this project is sourced from the [FIDE website](https://ratings.fide.com/download_lists.phtml), 
    which provides monthly updates. I downloaded data spanning **the last 10 years**, resulting in 120 text files containing 
    information on all players registered with FIDE‚Äîa significant amount of data!

    Since my primary goal was to gain insights into how well countries perform in chess, I decided to focus on the top 
    100 strongest players from each country.

    After preprocessing the data, I created a PostgreSQL database consisting of three tables:

    # Table descriptions
    st.markdown("""
    **players:** Contains static player information:
    - `id`: Unique identifier for a player.
    - `name`: Name of the player.
    - `sex`: Gender of the player.
    - `b_day`: Year of birth.

    **countries:** Stores geographic attributes:
    - `code`: Country code.
    - `country`: Name of the country.
    - `subregion`: Subregion the country belongs to.
    - `continent`: Continent the country is part of.

    **monthlyupdates:** Holds dynamic player information that changes monthly:
    - `id`: Unique identifier for a player.
    - `rating`: Standard Elo rating.
    - `activity_status`: Indicates whether a player is active or inactive 
    (inactive if no professional game was played in the past year).
    - `number_of_games`: Number of games played in the current month.
    - `title`: Chess title of the player.
    - `fed`: Federation the player represents.
    - `group_index`: Custom attribute with four values: Open, Women, Junior Open, 
    and Junior Women. (For this project, all queries use `group_index='Open').
    - `ongoing_date`: The date the data was recorded.
